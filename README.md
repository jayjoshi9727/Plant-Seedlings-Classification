# Plant-Seedlings-Classification

# This is a readme file of our project. The main aim of our project is to correctly differentiate a weed from a crop seedling despite of varying composition and structure. Hence, a CNN model is created to classify images into 12 different plant species. 

# Requirements to run our code

Python 3.6 or higher 
TensorFlow 2.X
Keras
keras-Tuner
Sklearn
Matplotlib
Pillow
Numpy
Open-cv
Pandas
Glob

# Following is a step by step procedure of building a CNN model to correctly classify plant seedlings from their images.
